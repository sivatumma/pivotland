# Pivot Land
Contains Small chunks of code to solve specific problems

## This follows traditional Git-Flow mechanism
* **master** branch will always be the default, cloneable.
* **dev** branch is where people merge pull requests to.
* **release** branch is what is given to the testing the agreed features
* If **release** branch succeeds, it will be merged to **master** with little negotiations
* **hotfix** would be a branch which directly start from **master** to merge to it again, when immediate fixes needed in production
