# Pivot Land
Contains Small chunks of code to solve specific problems

## The Aim of this project
Is to write code to solve a specific problem, in whatever language on earth,    
and use the front facing code to execute everything from command-line-interfaces where that usecase has to be solved.
An example is python image resize run from a node web server when a request comes to do so.

## This follows traditional Git-Flow mechanism
* **master** branch will always be the default, cloneable.
* **dev** branch is where people merge pull requests to.
* **release** branch is what is given to the testing the agreed features
* If **release** branch succeeds, it will be merged to **master** with little negotiations
* **hotfix** would be a branch which directly start from **master** to merge to it again, when immediate fixes needed in production

### Problem kinds we wish to solve
It is easy to think about a solution. We can think but thought wont happen in machines unless we write code.   
We write code files that solve a '_specific_' problem.   
Like gesture listener for iPhone to configure what should happen when.   
Like download something on your machine in UK and send it to USA   
Like create documentation from the unix man pages   
**etc**.

### How would these things be useful ?
We wish to automate the coding process itself to a configuration style.   
We wish we could make all these code pages (gist-likes) to be used as part of an IDE like eclipse where you attach to make a graph of codes to execute.   
Where we can 'specify' (make a graph of codes) that execute on specifications.   
We only consider usecases and the code should be ready.   
In a way, Business arrival, agreements, understandings, feature offering discussions, commitment, architecture, configuration are what all would be from now on in software development. No coding at all.
